# Risk Analysis Formulas
## General Terms
- **Threat** - Events that intentionally or inadvertently cause harm
- **Likelihood** - Probability of a threat occuring
- **Impact** - Magnitude of the resulting loss when the threat occurs
## Qualitative Analysis
Relative prioritization that could use:
- Number scale (1 to 10)
- Specific terms (Certain or Likely and Moderate or Negligible)

> Typically, the impact will include the relative importance of the asset.
### Formulas
```
Risk = Likelihood X Impact
Risk = Likelihood + Impact
```
### Examples
```
Risk = 1 (L) + 5 (I) = 6 (Medium)
Risk = 9 (L) * 10 (I) = 90 (High)
```
