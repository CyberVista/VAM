# Risk Analysis Formulas
## General Terms
- **Threat** - Events that intentionally or inadvertently cause harm
- **Likelihood** - Probability of the threat occuring
- **Impact** - Magnitude of the resulting loss when the threat occurs
- **Risk** - A threat event that includes the likelihood and impact 
## Qualitative Analysis
Relative prioritization that could use:
- Number scale (1 to 10)
- Specific terms (Certain or Likely and Moderate or Negligible)

> Typically, the impact will include the relative importance of the asset.
### Formulas
```
Risk = Likelihood X Impact
Risk = Likelihood + Impact
```
### Examples
```
Risk = 1 (L) + 5 (I) = 6 (Medium)
Risk = 9 (L) X 10 (I) = 90 (High)
```
## Quantitative Analysis
Direct cost of impact using:
- Monetary values
- Percentages
### Terms
- **Asset Value (AV)** - Value of asset to organization, expressed as currency
- **Exposure Factor (EF)** - Loss of asset due to occurrence, expressed as percentage
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)** - Cost of a single occurrence, expressed as currency
- **Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)** - Number of occurrences in a year, expressed as whole or decimal number
- **Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)** - Cost of a all occurrences in a year, expressed as currency

> AV includes purchase price and perceived value
### Formulas
```
SLE = AV X EF
ALE = SLE X ARO
```
### Examples
```
SLE = $3M X 50% = $1.5M
ALE = $1.5M X 4 = $6M
```
