### About the Course
Whether itâ€™s the Blue, Red, or Purple Team, Vulnerability Management is a critical component in protecting the organization from cyber-attacks. Where the Security Operations Center (SOC) is responsible for putting out fires, the role of Vulnerability Management is to assess, prioritize, and resolve weaknesses in enterprise systems before getting the SOC involved. 

On top of detection and evaluation responsibilities, Vulnerability Analysts must know how to effectively translate reports and mitigation strategies to different stakeholders within the organization, from the SOC to the C-suite. Vulnerability Management is not just an audit to check a box, but a constant reevaluation process necessary for continuous and effective risk management.

The Vulnerability Assessment and Management course is a five-hour, online introductory training program to the field of Vulnerability Assessment, with an emphasis on reporting and analysis. This course also includes 2 hours of lab exercises plus an optional, custom live online session.
